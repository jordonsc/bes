Bes FastCGI Server
==================
The FastCGI implementation offers an interface to receive traffic from a FastCGI client (such as a web server) and
return a response.

In particular, there are HTTP implementations that allow a reasonably abstracted HTTP process for web purposes.

FastCGI contains 3 roles, each are supported however only the _Responder_ role has a built-in implementation.
